# Learn & Play
Learn & Play is a fictitious web application that provides a safe and interactive environment to kids, where they can Learn while playing games.

The technologies used: HTML and CSS JavaScript jQuery Bootstrap Google Fonts FontAwesome icons Adobe Illustrator Pixel bay images Freepik

The approach taken: The main idea. The main idea is to have a single platform where children at the age of 3-8 can learn while playing different games. I choose to do the drag and drop game. To accomplish a single platform environment, I had to develop the main play area and the games in different files linked by an iframe to the main page, displayed in a tab menu style.

About the game development: To develop the game, I had built the drag and drop with jQuery UI and incorporated the win/louse logic with javascript. Additionally, I have added a time countdown tied to the louse function, if the time countdown reaches 0, the Game Over message will display, otherwise, other logics are implemented.
