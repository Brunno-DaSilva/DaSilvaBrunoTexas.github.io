The approach taken: 
The main idea. The main idea is to have a single platform where children at the age of 3-8 can learn while playing different games. I choose to do the drag and drop game. To accomplish a single platform environment, I had to develop the main play area and the games in different files linked by an iframe to the main page, displayed in a tab menu. 

About the game development. To develop the game, I had built the drag and drop with jquery and incorporated the win/louse logic with javascript.
